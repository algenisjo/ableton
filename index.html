        <p>Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001. Our 
            products are used by a community of dedicated musicians, sound designers, and artists

        <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. 
            The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.

    <p>
        Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and 
        many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide 
        range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us 
        have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere 
        in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each 
        of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something 
        big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

        Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to
         give our people what they need to work their magic and grow.
          We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building 
          teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems 
          from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each 
          other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

        Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively 
        supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached
         on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized
          development and music salons are a chance to discuss new 
          technologies, production techniques and best practices.

         family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave.
          Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have
           several company and team outings throughout the year as 
           well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.
